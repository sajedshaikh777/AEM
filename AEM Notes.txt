AEM Notes

Experience Manager Platform

The platform of Adobe Experience Manager 6.2 build on top of updated versions of the OSGi-based framework (Apache Sling and Apache Felix) and the Java Content Repository: Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.4.1.
The Quickstart uses the Eclipse Jetty 9.2.14 as servlet engine.





01. AEM Authors, Templates, Components

* A template defines the basic layout of your page.
* A component is primarily a kind of information which is displayed in a specific manner.
* Authors create and update content.
* You use components to add your content. Content could be a text, image, table, slide show etc.
* When you create a web page you create it based on a perticular template, which will provide you a kind of layout.


02. Introduction to AEM developers and CRXDE Lite

* Developers create templates and components.
* A template defines the layout of your web page.
* Authors select a specific template before they create a page.
* A component allows to display a specific information in a certain format.
* Site admin a tool to create web pages.


* CRDX Lite is developers web console.
* Content is the folder where all user generated pages exist.
* Apps is the folder where you create templates and components, associatable with your project.
* CQ TEMPLATE is the property associated with all templates.
* sling:resourceType property of a template points the script that is used to render the layout.
* JSP is a template language in which all the templates are crated.
* All the existing templates are created using JSP. In AEM's context it is called templating language.
* In AEM 6.0 relese Adobe introduces a new templating language called Sightly.
* Sightly is HTML5 and very easy to use.
 

03. Create your first AEM template

* Choosing the right template is the fundamental part of page creation.


07. Summary_ The first step of developing template in AEM

* AEM creates webpages.
they use templates which provides you the layouts of the web pages.
they use components to display information to be displayed on the pages.
Developers ceates templates and components based on the various requirements of the orgnisations.

* Site Admin 
- Used by authors to web pages

* CRXDE Lite 
- Used by developrs to expolore crxde repository ie. OAK repository. 
- This web console is used to create templates and components.

CRXDE Lite Folders
1. content folder 
- All pages we create goes here

2. apps folder 
- Developers create their company pages here.
- aem-company folder
it contains two folders viz, conponents and templates folder. They are primarily created for this templates and components respectively.

template has a resourceType property which points to the component in the components folder. 
This component is called page coponent. 
It is used to create a layout of the page.
This page component has resourceSuperType property which points to page componet inside libs/foundation/components/page
We have created a body.html which is called the rendering script in HTML format because we have used slightly which is much similar to HTML5
We haved pasted the HTML content diirecty in to the content.
We have added "data-sly-resource" tag to include "parsys" conponent.
"iparsys" component is used for sidebar.
The "parsys" component helps to drag and drop components while authoring the web page.
We placed css inside etc/design folder 

For editing
1. Authors should go to classic UI first
2. From the side kick they need to go to the design mode
3. Click edit 
4. Enable the components that they want to use 
5. After they do that they would be able to drag and drop components 


3. etc/designs folder
- Developers stores a design pages here.



* CRX Package manager 
- Used by developers to share code they develop



08. Create your sightly component

09. AEM dialogs

* AEM dialogs are used to enter information to a component 




* Bundles helps to modularize java development using the open source getway initiative OSGI framework.
* A bundle is essentially a jar file that you deploye in the apache felix console.
* Felix console is sub OSGI container
* To make it simpler, to accomplish a complex task you can deply a bundle in the felix console that runs with AEM and the awaits the services offered by bundle.


*Command to create and AEM project using a Maven Architect

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo.adobe.com/nexus/content/groups/public/ -DarchetypeGroupId=com.day.jcr.vault -DarchetypeArtifactId=multimodule-content-package-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.2 -DgroupId=aem-company -DartifactId=myproject -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.aemcompany.myproject -DappsFolderName=myproject -DartifactName="My Project" -DcqVersion="6.0" -DpackageGroup="AEM Company"


* Architect is a project templating toolkit, basically it creates a sample project from which you can start your work.
* After running the above command a project structure is created.
* Now To deply this project to felix console go to project directory 

$ cd myproject

and run following command

$ mvn -PautoInstallPackage install


* Then login to system console and locate the bundle
